This branch is divergent by design because that's one of the ways GitHub uses
to deploy static content to a web address, which in this case is
https://za-creature.github.io/cf-emu

In addition, many commits are pushed by bots that are run from a GitHub-managed
git hook, currently known ones are:
- "GitHub Actions <no-reply.actions.cf-emu.za-creature@github.com>"
